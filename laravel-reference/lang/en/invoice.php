    <p>CGP Europe&rsquo;s invoicing policy is changing!</p>
    <p>As of 28 September 2020 we will only be able to accept and pay invoices registered under the new &lsquo;Invoices&rsquo; menu item on the Experts&rsquo; Dashboard.</p>
    <p>ATTENTION! THE &lsquo;INVOICES&rsquo; MENU ITEM OF THE EXPERTS&rsquo; DASHBOARD IS NOT AN INVOICING PROGRAMME; IT DOES NOT SUBSTITUTE THE INVOICES YOU ISSUE. IT IS ONLY FOR REGISTERING AND UPLOADING YOUR INVOICE IN AN ELETRONIC FORMAT.</p>
    <p>You can register your invoices between the 1st and the 10th of each month.</p>
    <p>You can do it by opening the &lsquo;Invoices&rsquo; menu item then clicking the &lsquo;Add new invoice&rsquo; button.</p>
    <p>After registering the first invoice, the Dashboard will remember your invoicing data, such as:</p>
    <p>Name of the issuer of the invoice,</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Email address of the issuer of the invoice,</li>
        <li>IBAN and SWIFT code,</li>
        <li>Name of the bank,</li>
        <li>Address of the bank,</li>
        <li>Target country,</li>
        <li>Currency.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You only need to enter these details when registering your first invoice. They will be displayed automatically when you register additional invoices. You can edit them by clicking the edit icon after each data field.</p>
    <p>You have to fill in the following fields for each invoice:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Number of the invoice</li>
        <li>Issue date of the invoice</li>
        <li>Total amount</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If the content or form of the digitally uploaded invoices is incorrect, we won&rsquo;t be able to process them and they will be rejected. We will send you an e-mail about the rejection, specifying the reason.</p>

    <p>You can view your registered invoices by clicking the &lsquo;List of invoices&rsquo; button within the &lsquo;Invoices&rsquo; menu item. You can indicate here which invoices have already been paid and which haven&rsquo;t. CGP Europe will be automatically notified of the latter, so that we can take action and resolve any issues as quickly as possible.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If you have any questions regarding the invoicing process, please send them to finance@cgpeu.com, however, you don&rsquo;t need to forward your invoices to this email address after 28 September 2020. Instead, please register your invoices under the &lsquo;Invoices&rsquo; menu item on the Experts&rsquo; Dashboard according to the above.</p>
    <p>We hope that the new &lsquo;Invoices&rsquo; menu item will make it easier for you to manage your invoices and track payments.</p>',
