            <p>As you have already noticed, we are constantly looking for online solutions to make working together easier and more transparent. Accordingly, we are planning a new development on Expert Dashboard in autumn.</p>
            <span>The focus of development this time will be on creating your own Profile menu. The Profile menu will contain contact details of experts, such as</span>
            <ul>
                <li>e-mail address,</li>
                <li>address,</li>
                <li>phone number,</li>
            </ul>
            <span>and a scanned version of the following important documents</span>
            <ul>
                <li>adocuments of your professional qualifications</li>
                <li>a signed contract between CGP Europe and the expert.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We kindly ask you to click on the following button and fill out the empty datablocks and also make sure that the given informations in the already filled out ones are correct. If you find any discrepancy, please enter the correct data in the field. In addition, please upload the scanned agreement and documents of your professional qualifications.</p>
            <p>Thank you for your cooperation!</p>

            <p>We have noticed that the upload of the documents is still not completed. We don\'t want to waste your time, so now we will save the contact details in the new Profile menu, which you can view after proceeding.
            <strong><span style="color:#f70000; font-family: CalibriB;">Please prepare the scanned versions of the missing documents until your next login because uploading them will be mandatory, and you will only be able to access the dashboard when you uploaded them.</span></strong></p>
