<p>Dear {{preg_replace("/\baccount\b/i", "", $user->name)}}!</p>

<p>The end of this month is approaching. We kindly invite you to revisit client profiles menu to make sure there is no data missing or failures. Should you find some, please change these in accordance so that the generation of main invoicing base could be flawless.</p>

<p>To detect any failures, please visit 'Invoices' menu. Wherever you find the sign of a 'red screen' there is a lack of data for that company. In order to perform changes, please go to 'Settings / List of companies / Edit' menu to complete / fix missing data. Once you finished, all red monitor signs should be disappeared.</p>

<p>It is very important that all changes should be made prior to the last day of the month. Should you do this otherwise, you won't be able to perform invoicing for those companies where we have data failures in the system under client profile.</p>

<p>Thanks for your support.</p>

<p>Best regards,
    <br/>
    EAP Team
