    <p>Dear EAP Client,</p>

    <p>Thank you for having called upon our services. We hope our very first contact has already met your expectations and that – going forward - we will be able to help you sort out your professional or private issue.</p>

    <p>In order to assist you in the best possible way, we would like to inform you on some practical matters and on what you may – and may not – expect of the Employee Assistance Programme (EAP). These are reflected in the attached file. We kindly ask you to read through it carefully. Should you have any additional questions, your EAP professional will be happy to provide the necessary answers.</p>

    <p>We would also like to point out that we will store some private data in our digital files during the support process. This only to ensure we can properly track it; no personal information will be shared with your employer or any other third party. Should you object to this, please contact us at eap@pulso-group.com </p>

    <p>For your information: If a face-to-face session is organised following your contact with the Employee Assistance Programme, your EAP professional will present you a similar document. Through this document you will also be asked to agree that your EAP professional keeps your personal data in his file. You can agree with this by signing the document.</p>

    <p>Last but not least, we would like to follow up your experience with our service. We would like to find out how you are feeling, currently and after a while. At the end of our service we would also like to know what you think about the programme, if you have any remarks or suggestions. This information helps us to continually improve our service and will be valuable for you and your colleagues who will appeal on the service afterwards. </p>

    <p>In order to guarantee a good case follow up, we would like to ask 2 minutes of your time to know how you are currently feeling. We will repeat this at the end of our service.</p>

    <p>We trust this letter and our programme will provide you the guidance you are looking for.</p>

    <p>Kind regards,</p>

    <p>The EAP team</p>
